###  Submission Form Responses for an Iran Energy Transition and CO₂ Reduction Prize

#### **1. What problem are you aiming to address through this competition?**

**Updated Response:**  
This competition targets Iran’s lack of a comprehensive energy transition strategy to reduce its escalating CO₂ emissions and align with global climate goals, despite economic sanctions and isolation. Iran’s projected 2025 CO₂ emissions of 985 million metric tons (Mt) (*ScienceDirect 2015*) reflect its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, which constitute 98% of its energy exports (*World Bank 2022*). Kazem Kashefi, Asia-Pacific representative to the UN Climate Change Adaptation Committee (2018-2024), notes that Iran currently lacks a unified energy transition roadmap, with efforts fragmented across sectors (*OPEX.ir, 2025*). This gap hinders progress toward the IPCC’s target of 10 gigatonnes (Gt) of global CO₂ removal annually by 2050, of which Iran’s proportional share could be 200 Mt. The problem is compounded by sanctions limiting access to global carbon markets and technologies, necessitating a localized, innovative approach to decarbonization and sustainable energy adoption.

**Example Connection:**  
Like the Ansari XPRIZE’s challenge to the idea that "only big governments can launch people into space," this competition disputes the notion that "sanctioned nations like Iran cannot lead in energy transition or CO₂ reduction." It aims to prove that Iran can develop a scalable, sanction-resilient roadmap to cut emissions and contribute to global climate efforts.

#### **2. In order to address the problem you identified, what breakthrough(s) are needed?**

**Updated Response:**  
To address Iran’s energy transition and CO₂ reduction challenges, the following breakthroughs are critical:  
- **Localized Energy Transition Roadmap:** A comprehensive, government-led framework, as urged by Kashefi (*OPEX.ir, 2025*), integrating renewables (e.g., Iran’s 42 GW solar/wind potential), carbon capture, and efficiency under a supra-ministerial body like the Vice Presidency for Science and Technology.  
- **Sanction-Proof Technologies:** Innovations in low-cost, domestically producible solutions—e.g., enhanced weathering, biochar from agricultural waste, or small-scale CCS using Iran’s oil reservoirs—avoiding reliance on restricted imports.  
- **Value-Added Pollution Control:** Methods inspired by the University of Petroleum’s workshop (*Instagram, 2025*), converting air pollutants (e.g., CO₂, SOx) into economically valuable products like biofuels or construction materials, enhancing sustainability and profitability.  
- **Scalable Reduction Capacity:** Technologies starting at 10,000 tons of CO₂ reduction/removal annually, scaling to 200 Mt by 2050, aligning with BP’s 2050 outlook of doubled global economic activity driven by emerging economies (*OPEX.ir, 2025*), where Iran could lead among Asia-Pacific nations.  

**Example Connection:**  
Just as the Ansari XPRIZE sought to show that "private industries can build great space flight vehicles," this competition aims to demonstrate that Iran can pioneer a sanction-resilient energy transition, leveraging local expertise (e.g., IPCC AR7 contributors like Diana Urge-Vorsatz) and resources to meet global climate standards.

#### **3. Describe what the winning team must do to win your proposed competition.**

**Updated Response:**  
To win this Iran-focused energy transition and CO₂ reduction prize, the winning team must:  
- **Demonstrate a Pilot Solution:** Deploy a technology in Iran that reduces or removes 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually by September 2025 (post-workshop timeline), using local resources—e.g., solar-powered CCS at a dam like Karun-3 (2,000 MW) or pollutant-to-product conversion inspired by the University of Petroleum’s Barcelona workshop (*Instagram, 2025*).  
- **Develop a National Roadmap:** Propose a detailed energy transition plan under a supra-ministerial framework, as Kashefi suggests (*OPEX.ir, 2025*), modeling costs and scalability to reduce 1 million tons (megatonne) annually by 2035, with a pathway to 200 Mt by 2050, integrating renewables, CCS, and green chemistry.  
- **Ensure Economic and Environmental Value:** Show how their solution creates added value (e.g., turning CO₂ into marketable products) and sustains air quality improvements, drawing from European projects showcased in the workshop, while remaining sanction-proof through domestic manufacturing.  
- **Engage Global Expertise:** Incorporate insights from IPCC AR7 authors (*IPCC Webinar, 2025*) to ensure scientific rigor, proposing a domestic carbon trading system or bilateral credit sales (e.g., with China at $10/ton) to fund expansion despite market exclusion.

**Example Connection:**  
Similar to the Ansari XPRIZE’s requirement to "build a reliable, reusable, privately financed spaceship capable of carrying 3 people to 100 km twice within 2 weeks," this competition demands a team to deliver a practical, scalable CO₂ reduction system and roadmap for Iran, proving it can thrive in isolation and set a precedent for emerging economies by 2050, as BP predicts (*OPEX.ir, 2025*).

### Supporting Insights
- **Iran’s Context:** 985 Mt CO₂ in 2025 needs a 200 Mt reduction (20%) for global alignment, requiring $65-95 billion (*prior estimate*). Sanctions force reliance on local innovation, as Kashefi emphasizes government-led coordination (*OPEX.ir, 2025*).
- **Global Outlook:** BP’s 2050 vision (*OPEX.ir, 2025*) sees emerging economies like Iran driving 70% of global growth, necessitating energy transitions. The IPCC AR7 call (*IPCC, 2025*) highlights diverse expertise, which Iran could tap via its scientists.
- **Workshop Relevance:** The University of Petroleum’s event (*Instagram, 2025*) offers practical methods (e.g., CO₂ capture, green tech) adaptable to Iran’s industrial sites, enhancing economic viability.

### Conclusion
This prize updates the XPRIZE Carbon Removal model for Iran, addressing its fragmented energy strategy (*OPEX.ir, 2025*) with a sanction-resilient, value-adding approach. It leverages local potential and global trends (*BP, IPCC*), requiring a 10,000-ton pilot, a 200 Mt roadmap, and sustainable innovation by 2050—positioning Iran as a climate leader despite challenges.
